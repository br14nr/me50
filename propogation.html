                    <p>
                      A plant cutting is a piece of a plant that is used in horticulture for vegetative propagation. A piece of the stem or root of the source plant is placed in a suitable medium such as moist soil. Wikipedia

                    <h2>Layering</h2>
                    <p>
                      Layering has evolved as a common means of vegetative propagation of numerous species in natural environments. Layering is also utilized by horticulturists to propagate desirable plants. Natural layering typically occurs when a branch touches the ground, whereupon it produces adventitious roots. Wikipedia

                    <h2>Division</h2>
                    <p>
                      Division, in horticulture and gardening, is a method of asexual plant propagation, where the plant is broken up into two or more parts. Both the root and crown of each part is kept intact. The technique is of ancient origin, and has long been used to propagate bulbs such as garlic and saffron. Wikipedia

                    <h2>Grafting</h2>
                    <p>
                      Grafting or graftage is a horticultural technique whereby tissues of plants are joined so as to continue their growth together. The upper part of the combined plant is called the scion while the lower part is called the rootstock. Wikipedia
